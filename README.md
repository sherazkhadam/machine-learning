# Role of Various Distance Metrics on Clustering Results

## Overview

This tutorial explores the impact of different distance metrics on clustering results using **Agglomerative Clustering**. We evaluate three distance metrics: **Euclidean**, **Manhattan**, and **Cosine similarity**, and how they influence cluster formation. The **Wine Quality Dataset** is used for the analysis, which contains chemical properties of wines.

## Goal

By the end of this project, you will:
- Understand how distance metrics affect clustering.
- Learn about **Euclidean**, **Manhattan**, and **Cosine** distance.
- Compare clustering results using different distance metrics, evaluated with **Silhouette Scores**.

## Key Concepts

- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together.
- **Silhouette Score**: A metric to evaluate clustering quality.
- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures straight-line distance between points.
- **Manhattan Distance**: Measures the sum of absolute differences.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between vectors.

## Requirements

Install required libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Conclusion

The project helps understand the role of different distance metrics in clustering. You can select the most appropriate metric based on your data and clustering goals.
